//Anatomy of Function
//Ex. Command-> func functionName (Parameter1 : Type, Parameter2 : Type) -> return (to what type) { return }
//above example fully seen on version 3 of getMilk function below


//Creating the getMilk1() function - Version 1 demonstrates a number of instructions that could bundled within function
func getMilk() {
    print("received order to get milk")
    print("go to the shops")
    print("buy 2 cartons of milk")
    print("pay 100")
    print("come home")
}

//version 2 of getMik() -> the function could now take INPUTs from and use it in executing its function
func getMilK2(howManyMilkCartons : Int) {
        print("received order to get milk")
        print("go to the shops")
        print("buy \(howManyMilkCartons) cartons of milk")

        let priceToPay = howManyMilkCartons * 560 //php for each milk

        print("pay \(priceToPay)")
        print("come home")
}

//version 3 of getMilK() it doesn't only take 2 parameters here but also returns an output in a form of change from the howMuchWasGiven
func getMilK3(howManyMilkCartons : Int, howMuchWasGiven : Int) -> Int {
        print("received order to get milk")
        print("go to the shops")
        print("buy \(howManyMilkCartons) cartons of milk")

        let priceToPay = howManyMilkCartons * 560 //php for each milk

        print("give \(howMuchWasGiven) and pay \(priceToPay)")
    
        let change = howMuchWasGiven - priceToPay
    
        print("come home")
    
        return change
}


//call the getMilk() function

getMilK3(howManyMilkCartons: 1, howMuchWasGiven: 1000)
var amountOfChange = getMilK3

//Robot states after buying milk
print("Hello Master, here's your \(amountOfChange) peso change")
