## NOVICE
As a Novice iOS Developer, you can build very simple apps with table views and buttons.
You know the basics of iOS and Swift (or Objective-C min), and
Know how to find and read the official docs to learn more

## BEGINNER
As a Beginner, you have the skills you need to put an app in the App Store.
You’re comfortable placing views to create slight more complex layouts, and
You can handle networking, JSON, and displaying dynamic data in table views.
You can create sequels between view controllers and pass data from one screen to the next

## INTERMEDIATE
As an Intermediate Developer, you’re able to store data on the user’s device, customize views, and use more of the built-in frameworks to display maps and photos.
You’re comfortable with sizing and placing views using Auto Layout, 
Debugging code in Xcode, and
Taking advantage of Swift’s power and flexibility.
You write automated tests for the critical parts of your app to ensure your code works as it should

## ADVANCED
As an Advanced iOS Developer, you think and see things differently.
You’re starting to develop an intuition about when to use certain patterns and frameworks, and when not to.
You’re comfortable laying out complex designs with Auto Layout and creating animations for them.
Your code is easy to reason about, an you write unit tests regularly for each layer of the app

## EXPERT
As an Expert, you know how to best architect your code of reuse, readability, and maintainability.
You know Swift intimately, and you can read and maintain Objective-C code.
You can pick up new iOS frameworks with ease; if something’s possible to do in iOS, you can get it done.
You’ve done internationalization, localization, and accessibility to make your apps more accessible to all types of users.
And  you do it all beautifully, simply, and consistently
